README

This program, autoReuse, will periodically check your email mailbox for messages from specific people with specific 
keywords.  The program will then auto respond for you with a prewritten message.  If you are waiting for an laptop to appear on reuse,
this program will claim the item for you so that you do not have to check your email every couple minutes.

AutoReuse only reads emails that has not been opened yet.  This acts as a control that prevents
autoReuse from sending duplicate responses for the same email.  If you mark an email message as unread, a duplicate
message may be regenerated. 

In the Config file("config.txt"), the following information needs to be filed in.  

mailserver:  the imap server address of your mail account.  It is usually imap.(youremailprovider).com
username:  The username of your email account.  The password will be asked for separately.  
keywords:  Keywords that the program use to filter the email messages.  Keywords need to be separated by a comma and a space character.  
excluded_keywords:  Keywords that should not be included in the file.

In the TempateFile("ReuseTemplate.txt), the auto-generated response template is needed.
